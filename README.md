üîê Password Strength Prediction Using Machine Learning
In today‚Äôs digital world, securing online accounts is more important than ever. One of the simplest yet most crucial steps is creating a strong password. This project, Password Strength Predictor, is built to help users understand how secure their passwords really are ‚Äî and how they can make them better.

Using a combination of machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes passwords based on factors like length, complexity, and the use of special characters. It then classifies them as weak, medium, or strong, giving users instant feedback and suggestions to improve their choices.

The model was trained on a custom dataset and evaluated using popular machine learning techniques including:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Each model was tested for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable results. Advanced methods like bootstrapping were also used to make the predictions more robust and reduce overfitting.

What makes this project special is its focus on user experience. It‚Äôs not just about telling users their password is weak ‚Äî it‚Äôs about explaining why, and how to fix it. The goal is to encourage better cybersecurity habits and protect individuals from digital threats.

Built using Python, with tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Pandas, this project combines powerful technology with practical value. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, student, or just someone who wants to stay safe online, this tool is a step toward a more secure digital life.
